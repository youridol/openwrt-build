# ── Why an own table, not `inet fw4` ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# Per-device blocks insert into `inet fw4 forward`, and fw4 tears that table
# down and rebuilds it on every reload — a plain firewall config change from
# any other app is enough. The restore hook only fires on `ifup lan`, so a bare
# `fw4 reload` drops the rule with nothing to put it back. For per-device
# blocks that is a known wart; for a control whose whole purpose is "this
# device must not reach the internet while I set it up" it is the worst
# possible failure: the rule lapses, the toggle still reads ON, and the new TV
# is on the internet while the UI says it is not.
#
# So the cut lives in its own table (`inet tctl_cut`), the way port-forward
# control already uses `inet tctl_pfw` and the limiter uses `netdev
# tm_ratelimit`. fw4 deletes its own tables, not ours, so the rule survives a
# firewall rebuild structurally rather than by being noticed and re-added.
# The keeper below still re-asserts it, because a wholesale `nft flush ruleset`
# (or `fw4 flush`) takes every table with it.
#
# ── Why prerouting, not just forward ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# A forward-hook rule only sees traffic the router FORWARDS. On a router
# running a transparent proxy — podkop/sing-box, passwall, homeproxy — that is
# not where client traffic goes. TPROXY intercepts at prerouting and delivers
# the packet LOCALLY; the proxy then originates its own outbound connections
# from the router. Neither leg is forwarded: client→router is input,
# router→internet is output. A forward-only cut misses all of it, and on such a
# router that is the bulk of the traffic, not an edge case. The toggle would
# read ON, the rule would genuinely be present, and the new TV would keep
# browsing — the exact lie this feature exists to not tell.
#
# So the primary rule sits at prerouting priority -300, ahead of every hook
# anything else is likely to use, and catches traffic on the way in, before
# anything can divert it. The forward chain is kept as a second layer.
#
# Traffic the router originates ITSELF never traverses prerouting (it goes
# output→postrouting), so the proxy's own outbound path, the router's VPN
# tunnels and its DNS are untouched — only traffic arriving FROM a LAN device
# is considered.
#
# ── Why interface matching ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Both chains say the same thing: "traffic from a LAN device that is not going
# to stay on the LAN is dropped". Interfaces, not addresses, because:
#
#   * IPv4 and IPv6 are both cut by the same rules. The per-device block
#     matches `ip saddr` and is v4-only; for a global cut a device holding a
#     SLAAC address would walk straight out over v6 while the UI claimed the
#     internet was off.
#   * LAN↔LAN keeps working, including between VLANs/bridges and out to
#     downstream routed subnets — those all resolve to a LAN device.
#   * Same-subnet traffic is bridged and reaches neither hook at all.
#
# At prerouting there is no `oifname` yet — the routing decision has not
# happened — so the equivalent question is asked of the FIB: `fib daddr . iif
# oifname` is the interface the packet would leave by. `fib daddr type local`
# answers the more important one first: is this addressed to the router? LuCI,
# SSH, DNS, DHCP and a VPN terminating ON the router all match it and are
# accepted before any of the LAN-device reasoning is consulted, so they survive
# even if that reasoning is wrong.
#
# Inbound flows (WAN→LAN through a port forward) are deliberately NOT cut:
# those exist only where the operator created a forward, this app already has
# a dedicated control for them, and killing them would remove yet another
# remote-admin path from an operator who is about to lose their LAN-hosted one.

. /usr/local/bin/trafficctl-fw.sh

# Same priority as port-forward control: after DNAT, and before fw4's
# flowtable rule at filter priority 0 — otherwise an offloaded flow would
# bypass the drop entirely.
CUT_PRIO="-190"
# Earlier than any prerouting hook something else is likely to use: raw (-300)
# sits ahead of conntrack (-200), mangle (-150) and dstnat (-100). podkop /

# The engaged state lives in tmpfs, and that is the whole point: a reboot must
# clear it. This is the one control in the app that can lock out its own
# operator — anyone administering the router through a LAN host (Tailscale on a
# NAS, a Cloudflare tunnel from a LAN box, a jump host) loses that path when
# the cut goes on, and persistent state would mean a reboot does not bring it
# back either. The remedy would become "be physically present".
