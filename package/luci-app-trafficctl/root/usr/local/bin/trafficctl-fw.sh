# ── MAC-keyed matching (address-family independent) ────────────────────────
#
# Everything in this package is keyed on the IPv4 address a DHCP lease gives a
# device, and every enforcement rule matches "ip saddr"/"ip daddr" — so IPv6
# walks past all of it (issue #67: 9.96 Mbit/s over v4 against a 10 Mbit/s cap,
# 151 Mbit/s over v6 to the same endpoint).
#
# The fix is NOT "add ip6 saddr next to ip saddr": with SLAAC and privacy
# extensions a client holds several v6 addresses at once and rotates them on a
# timer, so a rule written against one stops matching without warning — the
# same silent bypass, reached more slowly. The MAC does not rotate, and on the
# hooks used here the client's own frame is still intact, so it is what the v6
# rules are keyed on.
#
# Only the directions where that holds are covered; see tctl_block_add and
# tctl_ratelimit_add for which, and README/COMPATIBILITY for what is not.

# Named by absolute path, as it must be on the router; the tests sed this line
# into their scratch directory rather than have the shipped script carry a
# test-only override (same approach as the ledger and shapes paths below).
TCTL_LEASES_FILE="/tmp/dhcp.leases"

# The MAC behind an IPv4 address: DHCP lease first, neighbour table second.
# Fails (non-zero, no output) when neither knows it — a routed/downstream
# client has no lease and no neighbour entry here, and there is nothing to key
# a rule on. Callers must report that rather than assume coverage.
#
# The result is validated strictly, not merely trimmed: it is interpolated
# into an nft rule string, so anything but six hex pairs is refused.

# delivers shows up in a speed test; a block that reports success while the

# "block internet" is what people reach for as a parental control.
#

# ── Runtime WiFi enforcement ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The uci maclist is the durable half of a WiFi block; hostapd's running ACL is
# the half that decides whether the device is on the air *now*. The two drift
# apart whenever the runtime call cannot be made, and for a long time that
# drift was invisible: the calls below were fire-and-forget, their exit status
# discarded, so a router without hostapd-utils reported every block as done
# while the device kept browsing.
#
# So every entry point here reports how far enforcement actually got, as one
# of these words, and proves it by reading the state back rather than trusting
# a return code:
#
#   acl      - the running ACL was changed and the change was read back
#   ban      - no usable hostapd_cli; hostapd's ubus deauthed and banned the
#              client, which expires on its own (see TCTL_WIFI_BAN_MS)
#   none     - nothing could be applied or verified on the running radio
#   no-radio - ubus answered and no AP is running, so there is nothing to
#              enforce; the uci maclist applies when wifi next starts
#
# Only "acl" and "no-radio" mean the operator's intent is in force, and the
# functions return 0 for exactly those two.

# How long a ubus ban lasts, in milliseconds. Used only where hostapd_cli is
# unavailable: hostapd's ubus object has no ACL method (del_client, list_bans,
# get_clients, reload), so a timed ban is the strongest immediate measure it
# can offer. One hour is long enough to be worth doing and short enough that
# callers must keep calling it temporary rather than done.
