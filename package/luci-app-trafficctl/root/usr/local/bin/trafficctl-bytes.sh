# "src" names the counter source. trafficctl-totals.sh accumulates these into
# lifetime totals and the two sources have unrelated magnitudes (conntrack
# reports only live flows, the nft maps count since the table was built), so it
# has to be able to tell a source switch from a burst of traffic.
#
# "degraded" says whether the numbers can be believed AT ALL — see below. It is
# separate from "src" on purpose: src is about magnitude (and drives the
# rebaseline), degraded is about trust, and conflating them would make a change
# in trust look like a change of counter and throw away a delta for nothing.
#
# bytes_tcp / bytes_udp carry both directions summed, and exist only on the
# conntrack path — nft counter maps are keyed by address alone and cannot split
# by protocol, so trafficctl-bytes-nft.sh reports -1 there. -1 rather than 0:
# "unknown" and "no TCP traffic" must not render as the same number.

# Any offload mode (software, hardware, hardware-counter) bypasses conntrack counters
# for fast-path packets. Use nftables counters at forward priority -200 (before the
# flowtable at -150) which capture every packet regardless of offload state.
# Only pure "none" mode has accurate conntrack counters.
# Modes whose counters ARE synced back to conntrack ("*-counter") keep the
# conntrack path accurate; only the uncountered ones need the nft fallback.
# TCTL_FORCE_CONNTRACK is set by that fallback when the kernel lacks dynamic
# counter maps, so we don't bounce between the two.

# Reaching here with uncountered offload means the nft fallback was unavailable
# and we are about to read counters the forwarding path does not update.
#
# Two ways in, and the second is easy to miss:
#   * TCTL_FORCE_CONNTRACK — bytes-nft.sh bounced back because the kernel has
#     no dynamic counter map support. Observed on real hardware.
#   * fw3/iptables — there is no nft fallback to reach in the first place.
#
# The numbers that follow are not merely imprecise, they are FROZEN for every
# offloaded flow: they stop moving while traffic continues. Left unflagged, a
# lifetime total accumulated from them looks authoritative and simply stalls,
# which reads as stale statistics rather than as a broken counter — the same
# shape as the 2 GiB %d freeze (#56), and harder to notice than the tiny live
# values that prompted #26, because the number is plausible.
