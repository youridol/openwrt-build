#   [{"dev":"eth1","label":"wan","role":"wan","tunnel":false,"primary":true,

#
# rx/tx are the kernel's own counters, i.e. relative to the INTERFACE, not to
# the client: rx on the WAN device is download, rx on br-lan is what the LAN
# sent upstream. Rates are not computed here — the frontend diffs two samples
# exactly as it already does for trafficctl-bytes.sh, so this script stays
# stateless and one sample cheap.
#
# Memory / fork discipline (128–512 MB routers; the dashboard polls this on
# its Poll interval, as often as every 2 s):
#   * the hot path is ONE read of /proc/net/dev and ONE awk — nothing else
#   * the role map is the expensive part (tctl_lan_subnets forks ubus and
#     jsonfilter per configured network, and merely sourcing trafficctl-fw.sh
#     runs `nft list tables`), so it is computed on a cold path and memoized
#     in tmpfs with a TTL, the same idiom the rdns and netify caches use.
#     trafficctl-fw.sh is therefore sourced ONLY inside build_cache()
#   * even the cold path classifies every interface in a SINGLE awk rather
#     than forking one per device out of a `while read` loop
#   * the cache is a few dozen bytes per interface and lives in /tmp, so
#     polling never touches flash
#
# Usage: trafficctl-ifaces.sh
