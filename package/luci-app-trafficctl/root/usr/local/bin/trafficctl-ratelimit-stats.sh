# One entry per target, counters summed across chains: the download rule is
# installed on every LAN device's egress chain, so a router with three bridges
# holds three copies of the same limit. Only the chain on the device the target
# actually lives behind ever matches, but which copy that is cannot be known
# here — taking any single one at random reported zero drops for most targets.
