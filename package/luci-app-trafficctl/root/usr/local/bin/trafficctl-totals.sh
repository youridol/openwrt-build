# Monotonic per-device byte totals — the single accumulator behind both the
# LuCI "Bytes / TCP / UDP" columns and the trafficctl_device_bytes_total metric.
#
# WHY AN ACCUMULATOR AT ALL (issue #26)
#   Neither byte source is a lifetime total. conntrack reports what its
#   CURRENTLY TRACKED flows have carried, so a device's number collapses the
#   moment its flows age out — which is why the columns were reported showing
#   values like "2 bytes". The nft counter maps are cumulative, but only since
#   the table was created, and that table is rebuilt on upgrade and gone after
#   a reboot. A lifetime total has to be accumulated from deltas and persisted.
#
# ONE STORE, ONE IMPLEMENTATION
#   This logic used to live inline in trafficctl-metrics.sh. It was lifted out
#   rather than copied: a second accumulator with its own state file would let
#   the UI column and the Prometheus counter report different totals for the
#   same device, and that is a bug report nobody can reproduce.
#
# SOURCE SELECTION is delegated entirely to trafficctl-bytes.sh, which already
#   switches to nft counters when flow offload stops conntrack from counting —
#   so the total stays right on exactly the routers where the complaint arises.
#   That switch can happen at RUNTIME (offload toggled in the firewall config,
#   or trafficctl-bytes-nft.sh bouncing back to conntrack on a kernel without
#   dynamic counter maps), and the two sources have unrelated magnitudes. The
#   source is therefore recorded per device, and a change rebaselines instead
#   of accumulating the difference as if it were traffic.
#
# STORE: /tmp, i.e. tmpfs, so totals reset on reboot. Deliberate: this file is
#   rewritten on every LuCI poll (2–10 s) and every scrape, and that write
#   volume into flash would wear out the router. Surviving a reboot would mean
#   a periodic flush to /etc/trafficctl (kept across sysupgrade by
#   lib/upgrade/keep.d) at a much coarser interval — a separate decision.
#
# Usage: trafficctl-totals.sh [--all]
#   default : one element per device in the current sample (what the UI wants)
#   --all   : also emit devices that are no longer in the sample but still
#             carry a total, so a Prometheus series does not vanish and
#             reappear every time a quiet device's last flow expires.
#
# Output: the trafficctl-bytes.sh array, each element extended with
#   bytes_in_total / bytes_out_total / bytes_tcp_total / bytes_udp_total,
#   total_since (unix time accumulation began for that device) and live.
#   The proto totals are -1 when the active source cannot split by protocol.
#
# TRUST: "degraded" is carried through from the sampler and is STICKY per
#   device. It means the counters the total was built from are frozen for
#   offloaded flows (uncountered offload with no usable nft fallback), so the
#   total is a lower bound that stops growing while traffic continues. One
#   tainted sample understates the total for the rest of its life, so the flag
#   cannot be cleared just because the next sample looked healthy — that would
#   re-present the same understated number as trustworthy. Consumers must
#   refuse to show it as a total, exactly as they refuse to show -1 as 0.
