#
# kind is "lan" for a directly connected subnet and "routed" for one reached
# via a next-hop on a LAN device (or listed in trafficctl.main.extra_subnets).
#
# This list is exactly the set a limit can be ENFORCED on: the netdev hooks
# that police traffic are attached to the devices these subnets resolve to, so
# a subnet missing from here (a masquerading non-lan zone, for instance) would
# take a rule that never matches a packet. The dashboard warns off such a
# target instead of pretending it applied.
