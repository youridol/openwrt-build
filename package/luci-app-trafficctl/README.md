Per-device traffic monitoring and control for OpenWrt routers. Monitor connections, limit bandwidth, shape traffic, block internet access, and manage WiFi MAC filtering -- all from a single LuCI page.

---

I built this because I wanted a reliable one-click way to cut my kids off the internet — and found that doing it properly on OpenWrt is surprisingly awkward. Most approaches either miss already-established connections (so the device stays online until the session times out on its own), or require navigating across several LuCI pages just to get something done.

Custom shell scripts solved the immediate problem. But once I had something working, I wanted to actually *see* what was happening on the network — who was online, how much traffic each device was generating, where they were connecting to. So I added a live traffic table.

That opened the door to more: which interface is each device on? What's the TCP state breakdown? What are the top destinations? One thing led to another, and the connection detail view followed.

A hard internet block also felt heavy-handed for everyday use — sometimes slowing a device down is better than cutting it off entirely. So I added rate limiting and traffic shaping via tc/HTB, with persistence across reboots.

After that, the focus shifted to making the whole thing convenient to live with: a recent-devices bar for one-click access, live sparkline graphs with a hover popup, a searchable device picker, configurable columns, activity logging.

The latest addition is Telegram — instant notifications when a new device joins the network, and the ability to block, unblock, or throttle any device directly from my phone without opening a browser.

I hope it turns out as useful for you as it has been for me.

## Features

- **Real-time Per-device Monitoring** -- View active connections per device with TCP/UDP counts, TCP state breakdown, destination IPs, and live bandwidth speed (sparkline graphs with rate limit overlay).
- **Global Overview** -- Optional whole-router panel (the **Overview** toggle in Settings > Display): uplink throughput graph, per-interface breakdown with WAN/LAN/VPN roles and sparklines, and a live top-talkers list. Reads per-interface kernel counters and the speed map the device table already computes, and polls on the existing Poll interval rather than a timer of its own.
- **Interactive Speed Graphs** -- Hover any sparkline for a full-size popup graph with: download + upload dual lines, gradient area fill, min/max band, crosshair with precise values, rate limit line, nice-value Y axis (multiples of 100/500 Kbit/s). Full history from page load.
- **Traffic Shaping (Queue)** -- tc/HTB classes on the LAN bridge with fq_codel leaf qdiscs. Queues excess traffic instead of dropping, providing smoother throughput.
- **Rate Limiting (Policer)** -- nftables or iptables-based packet dropping when a device exceeds the configured rate. Instant enforcement, no queuing. Unlike the shaper it owns no qdisc, so it works on a router already running SQM/cake — where the shaper deliberately declines rather than tear down somebody else's QoS, and says so.
- **Subnet / VLAN Limits** -- A limit can target a whole subnet (`192.168.20.0/24`) or the entire network, not only one device. Two readings of "20 Mbit for the IoT VLAN" are both available and are chosen explicitly: **each** gives every device its own 20 Mbit bucket, **shared** gives the whole VLAN one 20 Mbit bucket *between them* — the aggregate cap. Pick a monitored subnet from the target chips in the Speed Limit panel (select "All active devices" first); active subnet limits are listed there with their drop counters and a Remove button. Subnets the router does not monitor are flagged rather than silently accepted: a firewall zone other than `lan` with `masq=1` — the usual way to isolate a guest VLAN — is excluded from monitoring, and a limit on it would never match a packet. From the CLI: `trafficctl-ratelimit.sh 192.168.20.0/24 20000 "iot-cap" shared`.
- **Internet Blocking** -- Layer 3 drop rules per device. Connections are killed immediately and counter stats are tracked.
- **Global Internet Cut** -- One control that takes every device off the internet while the LAN keeps working, for plugging in a new device and configuring it locally before it is allowed out. Timed by default (15 min / 1 h / 4 h, or until you switch it back), so it reverts by itself. Devices keep reaching each other and the router, so LuCI stays available from the LAN; remote access that lands on a LAN host first (Tailscale on a NAS, a tunnel from a LAN box) stops while it is on. Traffic is stopped on the way in, at prerouting, so a transparent proxy running on the router (podkop/sing-box, passwall) cannot carry it out either — and the router's own traffic, including that proxy's outbound path, is untouched. It does **not** survive a reboot unless you tick "Keep after reboot".
- **WiFi MAC Filtering** -- Block any device from associating with WiFi via hostapd_cli deny ACL. Only the target client is deauthenticated -- no wifi reload, other clients stay connected. Works across all radio interfaces (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz) automatically.
- **Interface Detection** -- Shows actual connection interface: WiFi band (2.4G/5G/6G), LAN port name (lan2/lan3/lan4), or `routed` for clients behind a downstream router.
- **Downstream Routers** -- Devices on subnets behind a second router are monitored too: subnets with a route via a LAN next-hop are detected automatically, any flow this router NATs is attributed to its original source, and additional CIDRs can be listed in `trafficctl.main.extra_subnets`.
- **Port Forwards tab** -- Inbound traffic control for DNAT port forwards and router-local open ports: live connection/client/byte stats per forward, instant pause/resume (drop rule, no firewall reload) and inbound rate limiting.
- **Live Speed Polling** -- Optional polling with configurable interval (Off/1/2/5/10/30s) and averaging window (5s-5min); shows sparkline per device with spike filtering. Both can be stored as router-wide defaults via UCI (`poll_interval`, `avg_window`) for browsers that have not chosen their own.
- **Reverse DNS** -- Optional hostname resolution for external destination IPs with in-memory cache (no repeated lookups).
- **Searchable Device Picker** -- Command palette (search by name, IP, or MAC) with recent devices quick-access bar stored in localStorage.
- **Telegram Bot** -- Optional bot for remote control: device list, block/unblock, rate limit, shape traffic, new device notifications. Runs on the router via long polling, no external server needed.
- **New Device Detection** -- Discovers new devices via three sources: ARP table, DHCP leases, Wi-Fi station list. Instant DHCP hotplug trigger for near-realtime alerts.
- **Activity Logging** -- Configurable logging of all actions (blocks, ratelimits, shapes, config changes) to a local file and/or syslog. Includes source IP, username, and trigger (LuCI/Telegram/CLI).
- **Default Limit for New Devices** -- Optionally rate-limit or shape a device the first time it appears on the network (Settings > New Device Defaults). Off by default. Switching it on records the devices already present, so only genuinely new ones are affected, and a device that already carries a limit is never overridden.
- **Reboot Persistence** -- Shaping, block, and rate-limit rules optionally survive reboot via hotplug restore. Configurable per UCI option `persist_rules`. A rate limit keeps its bucket layout across the restore, so a subnet limited "5 Mbit each" does not come back as 5 Mbit for the whole subnet.

## IPv6 coverage

Everything here is keyed on a device's IPv4 address, so **IPv6 coverage is
partial and this table is the whole of it.** Read it before relying on any of
these controls on a dual-stack network.

| Control | IPv4 | IPv6 | Keyed on |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| Global internet cut (all devices) | ✅ | ✅ | interface (`oifname`/`fib`) — family-independent |
| WiFi block (MAC deny) | ✅ | ✅ | MAC — the client cannot associate at all |
| Block internet (per device) | ✅ | ✅ | address for v4, **MAC** for v6 |
| Rate limit — **upload** | ✅ | ✅ | address for v4, **MAC** for v6 |
| Rate limit — **download** | ✅ | ❌ | address only |
| Traffic shaping (tc/HTB), both directions | ✅ | ❌ | address only |
| Port-forward pause / limit | ✅ | ❌ | address only |
| Byte counters, speed graphs, totals, Prometheus | ✅ | ❌ | address only |

**Why not simply match `ip6 saddr` as well?** Because a client's IPv6 addresses
are not stable. With SLAAC and privacy extensions a device holds several at
once and rotates them on a timer, so a rule written against the address seen
today stops matching tomorrow — silently, which is worse than not having the
rule. The MAC does not rotate, so the rules that *can* be keyed on it are.

**Where a MAC cannot be used, and what happens then:**

- **Download** cannot be. By the time a reply is on its way to the client the
  destination MAC is the next hop's, and the rule sits on an address-matching
  hook. Doing this properly needs a named nft set per device, populated from
  `ip -6 neigh`/DHCPv6 and refreshed as addresses rotate — a data-model change,
  not a one-line match. A stale set is a silent bypass, so it is being done
  separately rather than quickly.
- **A device with no DHCP lease and no neighbour entry** — a client behind a
  downstream router, reached through `extra_subnets` or a static route — has no
  MAC this router can see. Its IPv4 rules are applied as before and the reply
  says **"IPv4 only"** in the message, in the LuCI status line and in the
  Telegram bot's answer, rather than reporting an unqualified success.
- **A downstream router itself** is excluded on purpose. Its MAC is the source
  address of every packet it forwards, so a MAC-keyed rule aimed at it would
  black-hole or throttle every client behind it. It too is reported as
  "IPv4 only", naming the reason.
- **fw3 / iptables (OpenWrt 21.02)** stays IPv4-only throughout.

If a device must be cut off completely and its IPv6 cannot be covered, the
**WiFi block** (for wireless clients) and the **global internet cut** (for all
devices) are family-independent and work regardless.

## Installation

> **Which file do I need?**
> - **Recommended**: v1.6.5+ (earlier releases are broken — missing status.css, invalid APK format)
> - OpenWrt **21.02 — 24.10** → download `.ipk` (opkg)
> - OpenWrt **25.12+** and snapshot → download `.apk` (apk)

Each release includes multiple filenames for the same package:

| Asset name | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `luci-app-trafficctl.ipk` | Stable download URL (opkg) |
| `luci-app-trafficctl_all.ipk` | Same file, OpenWrt naming convention |
| `luci-app-trafficctl_X.Y.Z-1_all.ipk` | Same file, version-pinned |
| `luci-app-trafficctl.apk` | Stable download URL (apk) |
| `luci-app-trafficctl_noarch.apk` | Same file, OpenWrt naming convention |
| `luci-app-trafficctl_X.Y.Z-r1_noarch.apk` | Same file, version-pinned |

The "stable URL" links below always download from the latest release — the filename stays constant across versions.

### OpenWrt 25.12+ (.apk)

**Option A — LuCI web UI:**
1. Download [`luci-app-trafficctl.apk`](https://github.com/YusDyr/luci-app-trafficctl/releases/latest/download/luci-app-trafficctl.apk) to your computer
2. In LuCI: **System → Software → Upload Package...**
3. Select the downloaded file and click **OK**

**Option B — SSH (recommended):**

```sh
cd /tmp && wget -O luci-app-trafficctl.apk https://github.com/YusDyr/luci-app-trafficctl/releases/latest/download/luci-app-trafficctl.apk && apk add --allow-untrusted luci-app-trafficctl.apk
# If you get "modified conffile" on upgrade, add `--force-maintainer` to override
```

> **Why `--allow-untrusted`?** OpenWrt does not sign individual `.apk` files —
> package signatures apply to a repository *index*, not to a standalone file
> downloaded from a GitHub release. Upstream removed per-package apk signing
> outright in October 2025. `--allow-untrusted` is therefore the normal way to
> install a single package file, not a security workaround being suggested
> lightly. If you want to pin what you install, download the version-stamped
> asset (`luci-app-trafficctl_X.Y.Z-r1_noarch.apk`) rather than the floating
> `latest` URL, so the file cannot change under you between download and
> install.

### OpenWrt 21.02 — 24.10 (.ipk)

**Option A — LuCI web UI:**
1. Download [`luci-app-trafficctl.ipk`](https://github.com/YusDyr/luci-app-trafficctl/releases/latest/download/luci-app-trafficctl.ipk) to your computer
2. In LuCI: **System → Software → Upload Package...**
3. Select the downloaded file and click **OK**

**Option B — SSH** (requires HTTPS support — `libustream-wolfssl` or `libustream-openssl`):

```sh
opkg install https://github.com/YusDyr/luci-app-trafficctl/releases/latest/download/luci-app-trafficctl.ipk
```

**Option C — SSH from your machine:**

```sh
ssh root@router 'opkg install https://github.com/YusDyr/luci-app-trafficctl/releases/latest/download/luci-app-trafficctl.ipk'
```

### Uninstalling

```sh
# OpenWrt 25.12+ (apk)
apk del luci-app-trafficctl

# OpenWrt 21.02 - 24.10 (opkg)
opkg remove luci-app-trafficctl

# either way, reload the LuCI backend afterwards
/etc/init.d/rpcd restart
```

Removing the package deletes its scripts and the LuCI page but leaves
`/etc/config/trafficctl` in place, so your settings survive a reinstall. Delete
it yourself if you want a clean slate:

```sh
rm -f /etc/config/trafficctl
```

Any blocks, rate limits or shapers that were active are **not** persistent
firewall/tc state — they disappear on the next reboot. To clear them
immediately before removing the package, unblock/unlimit the affected devices
from the dashboard first, or reboot the router after uninstalling.

If you also enabled the Telegram bot, stop it before removing:

```sh
/etc/init.d/trafficctl-telegram stop
/etc/init.d/trafficctl-telegram disable
```

### From source (OpenWrt build system)

```sh
# Add to your feeds.conf (the package depends on luci, so make sure
# luci is also configured — it is by default in feeds.conf.default):
echo "src-git trafficctl https://github.com/YusDyr/luci-app-trafficctl.git" >> feeds.conf

# Update both feeds (luci must be updated before trafficctl is scanned):
./scripts/feeds update luci trafficctl
./scripts/feeds install -p trafficctl luci-app-trafficctl

# Enable and build:
echo 'CONFIG_PACKAGE_luci-app-trafficctl=m' >> .config
make defconfig
make package/luci-app-trafficctl/compile V=s
```

### Manual installation

Copy the `luci-app-trafficctl/root/` tree to the router's filesystem, then restart rpcd:

```sh
scp -r luci-app-trafficctl/root/* root@router:/
scp -r luci-app-trafficctl/htdocs/luci-static root@router:/www/
ssh root@router 'chmod +x /usr/local/bin/trafficctl-*.sh /usr/libexec/rpcd/luci.trafficctl && /etc/init.d/rpcd restart'
```

## Quick Start

1. Install the package (see above).
2. Navigate to **Status > Traffic Control** in LuCI.
3. The summary table shows all active devices with connection counts, traffic, speed limits, and connection interface.
4. Use the search bar to find a device by name, IP, or MAC.
5. Select a device to see its per-connection detail table.
6. Use the action buttons to pause internet, block WiFi, or set a speed limit.

### Telegram Bot (optional)

1. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy the token.
2. Send any message to your bot and find your chat ID via `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates`.
3. In LuCI, expand **Settings > Telegram Bot**, enter token and chat ID, click **Test**, then **Save**.
4. In Telegram, send `/devices` to see the device list with action buttons.

## Configuration

### Speed Limit Modes

| Mode | Mechanism | Behavior | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Shaper** | tc/HTB + fq_codel | Queues excess packets | Smooth streaming, lower jitter |
| **Limiter** | nft `limit rate` / iptables `hashlimit` | Drops excess packets | Quick enforcement, low overhead |

### Persistence

**Note**: As of v1.6.5+, the runtime data directory is `/etc/trafficctl/` (previously `/etc/trafficmon/`).

- Shaping rules are always saved to `/etc/trafficctl/shapes.json` and restored on boot.
- Block and rate-limit rules are optionally persistent when `persist_rules` is enabled in Settings > Logging & Persistence (saved to `/etc/trafficctl/rules.json`).
- On reboot, the hotplug script at `/etc/hotplug.d/iface/99-trafficctl-shapes` restores all saved rules (shapes, blocks, ratelimits) when the LAN interface comes up.

### Activity Logging

- All mutable actions are logged with timestamp, source IP, username, trigger (luci/telegram/cli), and target.
- Log file: `/tmp/trafficctl/activity.log` (volatile; survives until reboot). Path and max lines are configurable via UCI.
- Optionally duplicates to syslog (`logger -t trafficctl`) for remote log collection.
- Per-category toggles: blocks, ratelimits, shapes, telegram, config changes.

### WiFi MAC Filtering

When a device is WiFi-blocked:
- Its MAC is added to the deny list on **all** wifi-iface sections via UCI.
- `macfilter=deny` is set on each interface that has no ACL policy yet. An interface already using `allow` (whitelist) keeps it, and blocking there means removing the MAC from the accept list.
- At runtime, `hostapd_cli deny_acl ADD_MAC` adds the MAC to the deny ACL and `deauthenticate` disconnects only that client. No wifi reload -- other clients stay connected.
- The ACL is then **read back** to confirm the entry landed. The UCI entry is durable but only applies at the next wifi restart, so a runtime step that did not happen is reported as a failure rather than as a block -- see `enforcement` in [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).

This needs the `hostapd-utils` package (pulled in by `LUCI_DEPENDS`). If it is
missing, trafficctl falls back to a temporary hostapd ban over ubus, says so,
and tells you to install it -- a device on the deny list that is still
connected is shown in the table as **not applied** rather than as blocked.

The frontend talks to a thin rpcd dispatcher over ubus. The Telegram bot provides parallel remote control via long polling. Backend shell scripts split into two groups: **monitoring** (read-only, pulls data from conntrack, ARP, DHCP leases, and wireless subsystems) and **control** (writes firewall rules, tc classes, or WiFi MAC filters). A firewall abstraction layer auto-detects nft vs iptables at runtime. All mutable actions are logged to a local file and optionally syslog. Rules optionally persist across reboots via hotplug scripts.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Test on at least one real OpenWrt device.
3. Ensure both nftables and iptables code paths work if your change touches firewall logic.
4. Keep the single-file JavaScript approach -- no bundlers, no npm, no transpilation.
5. Shell scripts must be POSIX sh compatible (BusyBox ash/dash).
6. All scripts emit JSON to stdout.

### Code Style

- **JavaScript**: ES5 syntax (LuCI compatibility), `'use strict'`, no external dependencies.
- **Shell**: POSIX `/bin/sh`, validate all IP input, output JSON only.
